//! Where an HTTP body comes from.
//!
//! Following a `<link>` to an `http(s)://` URL needs an HTTP client, and an
//! HTTP client means a TLS stack — about 126 crates. A login screen has no
//! links to follow and must not link any of that, so the renderer asks for the
//! body through a callback the embedder installs.
//!
//! This is deliberately the same shape as
//! [`sicompass_sdk::url_fetcher`], which solves the same problem one layer up
//! (there it is `lib_webbrowser` that registers the implementation). What
//! stays here is the interesting half — deciding whether the body is a
//! server-hosted FFON document or an HTML page — because that is a rendering
//! decision, not a networking one.
//!
//! With nothing registered, an HTTP link reports that it cannot be followed and
//! the node still renders. That is the greeter's behaviour, and it is also what
//! a build with no browser provider does.
